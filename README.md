# Current sensor module
This example shows how to measure the output of the current sensor and calculate the corresponding AC current with an ArduinoÂ® compatible board.

The example program reads the analog signal output from the ```S``` pin on the module, calculates the corresponding current, and prints the result in the serial monitor.
